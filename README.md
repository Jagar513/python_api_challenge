# Northern Hemisphere: Latitude vs Max Temp

# Southern Hemisphere: Latitude vs Max Temp

The linear regression models show that the Northern Hemisphere has a negative correlation between latitude and temperature while the Southern Hemisphere has a positive correlation. This is because the Northern Hemisphere temperature decreases as the latitude increases moving farther away from the Equator. The Southern Hemisphere has the opposite effect since it's moving towards the equator.

# Northern Hemisphere: Humnidity vs Latitude

# Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs Latitude

The linear regression models show that both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have a positive correlation with humidity and latitude. As latitude increases and gets closer to the Equator, humidity rises which suggests that areas near the Equator have higher humidity compared to other areas.

# Northern Hemisphere: Latitude vs Cloudiness

# Southern Hemisphere: Latitude vs Cloudiness

The linear regression model for both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere reveals a positive correlation between latitude and cloudiness; however, cloudiness increases more in the Southern Hemisphere. There is some fluctuation in cloudiness as you can see in both scatter plots the higher the latitude increases.

# Northern Hemisphere: Latitude vs Wind Speed

# Southern Hemisphere: Latitude vs Wind Speed

The linear regression models indicate a minor relationship that both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have with latitude and wind speed. Although there is no trend in the scatter plot for the Northern Hemisphere; the Southern Hemisphere shows a slight decline in wind speed when latitude increases. All things considered, it's clearly evident that latitude has no little to no impact on wind speed.
